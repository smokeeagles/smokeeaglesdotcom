## Who are the Smoke Eagles?

The Smoke Eagles is a non-profit flying community in Southern California. Based out of Fullerton Municipal Airport (KFUL) we fly two different Cessna aircraft (172K & 182P) between our 30 member organization. The club was originally started by a group of fire fighters and thus the origin of the "Smoke" + "Eagles".

The club has grown for more than 70 years and to date we are not sure if we have any fire fighters left, but we have just as much love for flying. So we continue on flying because…. ain’t it great!?! Over the years we have had tie-downs in Long Beach & Compton, and currently we house the aircraft at Fullerton Municipal Airport (KFUL).

Come join us!  We are a social club with approximately 30 members between two aircraft utilizing online booking and 24x7 access to the aircraft.  We do our best to keep flying economical for our members while still maintaining safe aircraft.  We have monthly meetings and a structured organization capable of managing the financial, maintenance and safety concerns found with a flying organization like ours.
