## Meetings

We hold open monthly meetings the first Tuesday of every month (almost) at AFI Flight Services at KFUL.  Due to COVID-19, these meetings are now hosted virtually.

All visitors are welcome. Meetings last about an hour, and are traditionally followed by no-host beer and pizza at a nearby restaurant during non-pandemic times.

Attendance by members is not required, but strongly encouraged. A quorum is needed to conduct club business.
